      <description>We are pleased to announce the second edition of Getting Started with R Paperback at OUP, Amazon UK, Amazon.com, Amazon.de, Buch.ch
Electric version at Oxford Scholarship Online.
We got great feedback about our book &amp;ldquo;Getting Started with R, An Introduction for Biologists&amp;rdquo;, but realised over the last couple of years that we were using and teaching R very differently from what we wrote about back in 2010. So we have almost completely rewritten for a very different and new Second Edition.</description>

      <description>Lost packages Here is a post Lost Packages about what to do if, when attempting to install a package you get a message like package ggfortify is not available (for R Version 3.2.4).
Importing data update If you&amp;rsquo;re having a brain melt figuring out the difference between read_csv and read.csv and their use in the RStudio Import Dataset tool, look at this post about using the readr package and read_csv function to import data.</description>
