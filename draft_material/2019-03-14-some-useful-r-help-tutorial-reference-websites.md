While writing Insights1 we came across and benefitted from from looking at lots of lovely web sites and ideas. Here are a few that we particularly liked.

* [Fundaments of data visualisation by Claus O. Wilke](https://serialmentor.com/dataviz/index.html). An online preview of the book “Fundamentals of Data Visualization” to be published with O’Reilly Media, Inc. (Maybe published by now.) Beautiful `ggplot` focused compiliation of visualisation guidelines and examples. R code available here: https://github.com/clauswilke/dataviz.

* [The Financial Times Visual Vocabulary website](http://ft-interactive.github.io/visual-vocabulary/), made "to assist designers and journalists to select the optimal symbology for data visualisations". Great for scientists too!

* [What they forgot to teach you about R](https://whattheyforgot.org/), by Jennifer Bryan, Jim Hester. "We focus on building holistic and project-oriented workflows that address the most common sources of friction in data analysis, outside of doing the statistical analysis itself."

* In some situation we did not discuss in the book, such as with RMarkdown, one can experience a bit of trouble wit RProjects and paths. This is solved by this lovely function `here`, by Kirill Müller. [Here is an amusing page about `here`](https://github.com/jennybc/here_here#readme)

* [Animations of joining/merging two datasets](https://github.com/gadenbuie/tidyexplain).

* [Some advice on good practice (and bad) for naming files](https://speakerdeck.com/jennybc/how-to-name-files) by Jennifer Bryan.

* What promises to be a nice add-on to pipes, by Benjamin Elbers, giving brief reports in the Console about what happened at each step of the pipe: [tidylog](https://github.com/elbersb/tidylog). Not so clear this would be stable/persistent at time of writing Insights1, so we include it here rather than in the text.

* [Simply Statistics](https://simplystatistics.org/). A nice website of articles about data analyses.

* [A tweet and replies about p-values](https://twitter.com/KevinDKohl/status/1090294240385683465) including an excerpt from an article discussing [The American Statistical Association statement about p-values](https://amstat.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00031305.2016.1154108#.XI3Yo1NKjOQ): *Practices that reduce data analysis or scientific infer- ence to mechanical “bright-line” rules (such as “p < 0.05”) for justifying scientific claims or conclusions can lead to erroneous beliefs and poor decision making.*

* Tweets about how beautifying graphs can be very effective procrastination [procrastination by beautification](https://twitter.com/amy_nusbaum/status/1092294218330996736), somewhat humorous, but also with an element of truth.

* Tweets about [the weird things we sometimes find in datasets](https://twitter.com/ericJpedersen/status/1091361839903096833).

* A nice way to get into regular expressions: [RVerbalExpressions](https://rverbalexpressions.netlify.com). "The goal of RVerbalExpressions is to make it easier to construct regular expressions using grammar and functionality inspired by VerbalExpressions. Usage of %>% is encouraged to build expressions in a chain like fashion."

* [7 Reasons for policy professionals to get into R programming in 2019](http://gilesd-j.com/2019/01/07/7-reasons-for-policy-professionals-to-get-pumped-about-r-programming-in-2019)

* [Excel is obsolete](https://appsilon.com/excel-is-obsolete-here-are-the-top-2-alternatives-from-r-and-python/). Use R (and Python) instead.

* Warning: a hideously intrusive website... [Forbes, You Can Reduce Business Risk By Phasing Out Spreadsheets For Business.](https://www.forbes.com/sites/metabrown/2017/10/30/you-can-reduce-business-risk-by-phasing-out-spreadsheets-for-business/#6d944dc847a0)
