## What does successful mean?

* That I, other instructors, and teaching assistants enjoy leading and teaching the course to a class of over 200 students from various degree programs in life and environmental sciences.
* Students that view the course as challenging, quite high workload, high value, and interesting/fun.
* That most of the students passing.

## Three little things...

1. Ensure your institution understands its prioritisation of teaching of data analysis, and the consequence of its prioristation. Level of prioritisation of related topics is also important, e.g. programming in biology and mathematics for biologists (including probability theory). I was given access to around 150 hours study per student during a 14 week semester. I received students that had taken programming in biology and mathematics for biologists courses. That my institution prioritises such skills so highly makes the students more prone to be engaged, which likely makes my job easier and more rewarding. If you don’t feel that your institution appropriately prioritises such skills, then this might be a good thing to try to change. It can involve arguing that one does more teaching and teaches more students, which leads to the second point…

2. Design a highly efficient course, meaning that students get high value per unit of instructor effort. An efficient course will be a pleasure for the students and instructors (everyone loves efficiency, even if they’re not explicitly aware of it).  Efficiency can be promoted in many ways: good use of e-learning tech., e.g. video tutorials, instant feedback questions, electronic grading of the final exam. One way in which I gauge the efficiency of my course is the proportion of the time I spend talking with small (ideally 1:1) groups of students (I do this for a class of over 200, see below for how). I don’t know what the proportion is, but increasing that proportion is a primary goal.

3. Design a learning experience that nurtures and stimulates students intrinsic motivation, and that avoids extrinsic motivation. High intrinsic motivation requires purpose, autonomy, and mastery.
 
### Purpose

* Relevance of subject matter for solving problems, employment, doing good, preventing bad etc.
* Live data analysis demonstration during first class.
* Interesting and practically important examples and exercises.
* During every practical class I made sure to talk with each and every student[1]. Getting to know each student a bit, building some rapport with them, and seeking to understand their experiences of the course helped me better help them on an individual basis, made me more invested in the course, and I believe helped them feel cared for (because I did care more about them than if I had not talked so much with them).
 
### Autonomy

* Treat the students like the adults that they are.
* Do not monitor attendance at lectures or in practicals. When asked “do we have to attend?” reply that “attendance is not monitored” and then that attendance would likely increase success and happiness in the course.
* Put all material available online (lectures, video tutorials, practicals, weekly assessments etc.)
* Give multiple sources of information that overlap in content. E.g. a video lecture and a book chapter that covered some of the same information. Let students figure out what combination of these worked best for them.
* Give students mandatory graded assessments each week, with instant feedback, but allowed student considerable freedom when complete them (one mid-term deadline, and one at the end of the course). In our class an average of 60% in these weekly graded assessments was required for admission into the final exam. The graded assessments scores did not contribute to the final grade.
* Facilitate student success via diverse learning approaches.
* Provide detailed and clear learning objectives, that are carefully tested to. With such learning objectives, a student should be able to pass the exam without participating in the class, i.e. by working through the objectives using any available sources of information (there was nothing to prevent this approach).
 
## Mastery

* Nurture a growth mindset… if they try then they will succeed.
* Give them early experiences of trying and succeeding.
* Make challenges hard enough, but not too hard; what this means differs greatly among students. 
* Give students a bit of what they expect/know and also some new things. We used some traditional methods (e.g. standard lectures) and also new methods such as video lectures and regular online assessments.
* Again, talk with students 1:1. For our class of about 200 students about two thirds regularly attended practical classes, and we had two classes, giving about 70 students per class. In a two hour class, I could therefore spend less than two minutes with each student. Mostly students sat and worked in pairs, so often it was often around 4 minutes per pair, per week. I didn’t always chat with everyone each week. This might not seem like much time, but it is certainly long enough to develop a genuine caring relationship with each and every student.
* We responded quickly to questions and comments on the online Discussion forum associated with the course. Students quickly started to answer each other’s questions.
