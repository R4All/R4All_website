*An Introduction for the Life and Environmental Sciences.*

{{< figure library="1" src="InsightsCoverSmall.png" title="" >}} 

We are pleased to announce our brand new book, *Insights from Data with R, An Introduction for the Life and Environmental Sciences.* We call it *Insights* for short.

It is published by OUP and available from the [OUP website](https://global.oup.com/academic/product/insights-from-data-with-r-9780198849827).

*Insights* is designed and written for undergraduates in the life and environmental sciences. It assumes no knowledge of statistics, data or programming.

*Insights* is intended as a go-to resource to accompany undergraduates during their first experience of working with data to get answers.


Unique/important features of *Insights* include:

* Based on very well received undergraduate data analysis courses taught by the authors.
* Students work along with data from real scientific studies published on data repositories.
* Has four detailed *Workflow Demonstrations*.
* Focuses on developing solid foundations of data management, summarising, and visualisation, to get robust and reproducible insights.
* Intentionally leaves statistical tests to subsequent courses/books.
* Uses RStudio and the *tidyverse*.

For more information about the book, please check out the [companion website](http://insightsfromdata.io/), where there are extensive additional resources (including three of the four Workflow Demonstrations).

Our other book *Getting Started with R, An Introduction for Biologists* is for people that have already some experience with data analysis, and that want to learn or improve their R competence and confidence.
