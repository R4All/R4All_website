Andrew is an evolutionary ecologists.  He is interested in how the environment affects organism traits and how this determines the distribution and abundance of species and the complexity and structure of their communities.  He's been using R for more than 20 years and specialises in enthusiastically explaining things three or four different ways.  He still likes learning to use new methods and tools.  He also rides bicycles a fair bit.
