Natalie Cooper's reasearch aims to understand broad-scale patterns of biodiversity. She uses cutting-edge phylogenetic comparative methods and various large datasets to investigate a variety of topics using R. She currently has projects on whales, snakes, dinosaurs, bryozoans, corals, pangolins, tenrecs, fishes, chameleons, amphibians and many more! Natalie is an advocate for diversity in STEM and reproducibility. In her spare time she likes to read, watch Netflix and climb mountains, while sticking it to the patriarchy.
