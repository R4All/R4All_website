{{< figure library="1" src="InsightsCoverSmall.png" title="" >}} Our second book, *Insights from Data with R, An Introduction for the Life and Environmental Sciences* will very soon be available (estimated February 2021). [More about *Insights* here]({{< ref "/books/Insights.md" >}}).


{{< figure library="1" src="SecondEdCover.png" title="" >}} The Second Edition of *Getting Started with R*, a major reworking from the first, is out! It still has a jellyfish on the cover, but just about everything else is different/revised. [More about the Second Edition here]({{< ref "/books/GSwR2.md" >}}).
